                                In the past I have written on how the track element can be used to add captions and
                                subtitles to HTML5 video, but this, and many other examples around the web, used a
                                static example. But what if you need to load this information dynamically? This is
                                what I’m going to take a quick look at here.

                                One ring to rule them all.

                                One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there
                                were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies
                                of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of
                                Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It
                                was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up
                                his father’s sword.

                                The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array
                                object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent
                                the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.

                                Update a caption track
                                The API supports the ability to change a caption track's draft status, upload a new
                                caption track for a file, or both.

                                You can use the APIs Explorer to test the ability to change a track's draft status.
                                However, you cannot use the APIs Explorer to update the actual caption track because
                                tool does not support the ability to upload files.

                                The request below retrieves a list of captions for a video on the Google Stories YouTube
                                channel:

                                The request updates the draft status of a caption track to true, which means the track
                                will not be publicly visible. To complete the request in the APIs Explorer, you need to
                                set the id property's value to identify a caption track.

                                Delete a caption track
                                This example shows how to delete a caption track. The example has the following steps:

                                Step 1: Retrieve the caption track ID

                                Follow the steps above to retrieve a list of caption tracks for a video. The list could
                                be used to display a list of caption tracks, using each track's ID as a key.

                                Step 2: Delete the track

                                Call the captions.delete method to delete a specific video. In the request, the id
                                parameter specifies the caption track ID of the track that you are deleting. The request
                                must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. If you are testing this query in the APIs Explorer,
                                you will need to substitute a valid caption track ID for the id parameter value.
                            </text>
                            <text>
                                You can use the API's captions.insert method to upload a new caption track for a video.
                                When uploading a track, you must specify a value for the following caption resource
                                properties:

                                snippet.videoId - This identifies the video to which the caption track is being added.
                                snippet.language - The language of the caption track.
                                snippet.name - The name of the caption track.
                                The following additional options are available when uploading a caption track:

                                If you set the sync parameter to true, YouTube will disregard any time codes that are in
                                the uploaded caption file and generate new time codes for the captions.

                                You should set the sync parameter to true if you are uploading a transcript, which has
                                no time codes, or if you suspect the time codes in your file are incorrect and want
                                YouTube to try to fix them.

                                If you set the caption resource's snippet.isDraft property to true, the track will not
                                be publicly visible.

                                See the captions.insert method's documentation for code samples.

                                what I’m going to take a quick look at here.
                                To extend a class: class Child extends Parent:
                                That means Child.prototype.__proto__ will be Parent.prototype, so methods are inherited.
                                When overriding a constructor:
                                We must call parent constructor as super() in Child constructor before using this.
                                When overriding another method:
                                We can use super.method() in a Child method to call Parent method.
                                Internals:
                                Methods remember their class/object in the internal [[HomeObject]] property. That’s how
                                super resolves parent methods.
                                So it’s not safe to copy a method with super from one object to another.
                                Also:

                                Arrow functions don’t have their own this or super, so they transparently fit into the
                                surrounding context.

                                You might want to return Array objects in your derived array class MyArray. The species
                                pattern lets you override default constructors.
                                For example, when using methods such as map() that returns the default constructor, you
                                want these methods to return a parent
                                Array object, instead of the MyArray object. The Symbol.species symbol lets you do this:
